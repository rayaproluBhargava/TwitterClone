This project is implemented using PHP, MySQL, HTML and CSS where the user can login into their twitter account and post tweets
The users can login with email id and password
The users can also logout of the session by clicking the logout button
The tweets posted by the user are displayed on the page and the tweets count is incremented automatically
The tweets posted by the user are sorted by date such that the latest tweet is shown at the top
If the user submits the tweet without entering any content, a message is displayed saying ‘Type your tweet’
If the user posts a tweet which is more than 140 characters, an error message is displayed saying ‘The text of the tweet is too long’
